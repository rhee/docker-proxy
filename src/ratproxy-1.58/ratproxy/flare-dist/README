This is a Linux binary of Flare ActionScript decompiler. If instructed
to do so, ratproxy will invoke this tool to decompile SWF files on the
fly.

If you intend to run ratroxy on a different operating system, you may 
need use the following binaries instead:

  MacOS X: http://www.nowrap.de/download/flare06mac.tgz
  Windows: http://www.nowrap.de/download/flare06doswin.zip

Unfortunately, there are no versions of Flare for *BSD or the like (but
binary emulation of Linux or Windows may come to the rescue). If Flare 
is not found, ratproxy will simply not perform Flash analysis.

Note that this is a closed source application; please exercise common
sense, and do not use it on potentially malicious, external content.
